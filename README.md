redis-mock
============
The goal of the redis-mock project is to create a feature-complete mock of https://github.com/mranney/node_redis, so that it may be used interchangeably when writing unit tests for code that depends on Redis.

All operations are performed in-memory, why no Redis installation is required.

Install with:

	npm install redis-mock

## Usage

```js
var redis = require("redis-mock"),
    client = redis.createClient(); 
```
