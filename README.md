redis-mock
============

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/redis-mock.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/redis-mock/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yeahoffline/redis-mock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yeahoffline/redis-mock)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/yeahoffline/redis-mock/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/yeahoffline/redis-mock)

The goal of the `redis-mock` project is to create a feature-complete mock of https://github.com/mranney/node_redis, so that it may be used interchangeably when writing unit tests for code that depends on `redis`.

All operations are performed in-memory, why no Redis installation is required.
100% redis compatible (see cross verification)

# Installation

````bash
$ npm install redis-mock --save-dev
````


## Usage

### node.js/io.js

The below code demonstrates a example of using the redis-mock client in node.js/io.js


```js
var redis = require("redis-mock"),
    client = redis.createClient();
```


# API

Currently implemented are the following redis commands:

### General
* createClient
* end

### Events
* ready
* connect
* end
* quit
* subscribe
* unsubscribe
* message

### Publish/subscribe
* publish
* subscribe
* unsubscribe

### Keys
* del
* keys
* exists
* expire
* ttl
* incr
* incrby
* incrbyfloat

### Strings
* get
* set
* mget
* setex
* setnx
* ping

### Hashing
* hset
* hsetnx
* hget
* hexists
* hdel
* hlen
* hgetall
* hmset
* hmget
* hkeys
* hincrby
* hincrbyfloat

### Lists
* llen
* lpush
* rpush
* lpushx
* rpushx
* lpop
* rpop
* blpop
* brpop
* lindex
* lset

### Server
* flushdb
* flushall




# Cross verification

If you want to add new tests to the test base it is important that they work too on node_redis (we are creating a mock...).
You can therefore run the tests using `redis` instead of `redis-mock`. To do so:

````bash
$ make check-tests
````


You will need to have a running instance of `redis` on you machine and our tests use flushdb a lot so make sure you don't have anything important on it.


# Roadmap
redis-mock is work in progress, feel free to report an issue


# Versions
0.4.7 update devDependencies (should, mocha)
